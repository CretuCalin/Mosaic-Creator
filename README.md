# Mosaic-Creator

Library written in python that you can use to create [Photographic mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic).
You can set the number of tiles on the horizontal and the number of tiles on the vertical will be calculated automaticaly, so the image will remain scaled.

You can convert almost any type of image, and for the tiles pictures, I suggest you to use images from [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or you can use your own dataset.

### Here is a demo : 

#### Probably the only way you can find out what's inside Maggie's head
